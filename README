Due to popular demand (that is, someone asked) I've copied the old PPT CVS archive into Github.

This is probably useful only for those who are really deep into software archeology, or those
who are interested in seeing how bad a programmer I was in the 1990s.

The original software was compiled using the SAS/C compiler, and does require the Amiga SDKs
to work.  But hey, if you're the kind of person who is likes to delve into this sort of stuff,
I'm fairly sure you know what to do with this :-)

Short: A Modular Image Processing Package
Author: Janne.Jalkanen@iki.fi
Uploader: Janne.Jalkanen@iki.fi
Type: gfx/conv
Version: 5.20

    PPT is a powerful, free image processing package, that boasts with the
    following properties:

    - Handles both 24 bit truecolor and 8 bit grayscale images with optional
      alpha channel.

    - Modular design, ie. you can easily add new loaders and filters to the
      program.

    - Internal multi-tasking: You can process/load/save many images at
      the same time! No need to wait for another project to be ready!

    - Unlimited (except by available memory) buffers!

    - Unlimited (except by available disk space) undo!

    - User configurable virtual memory (no MMU required)

    - AREXX port

    - Font sensitive and scalable GUI using Jan van den Baard's and Ian
      J. Einman's BGUI package (release 41 needed)

    - Quick preview window for fast updates.

    - Requires OS 2.0 (V37). Yes, this is a feature :) and uses some
      OS 3.0 (V39) features. Takes use of AGA chips if installed.  CyberGFX
      is also supported!

    - Loads following image types:
        o IFF ILBM (1-8 bitplanes, HAM6/8, EHB, ILBM 24 bit)
        o JPEG/JFIF (both grayscale and 24 bit.  Also progressive!)
        o PPM/PGM types P2, P3, P5 and P6.
        o PNG (all standard types)
        o Targa Truevision (8,15,16,24 and 32 bit formats)
        o YUVN
        o TIFF
        o Psion PIC format
        o Windows & OS/2 BMP
        o Anything you have a Datatype for...

    - Saves following image types:
        o JPEG/JFIF (both grayscale and 24 bit.  Also progressive!)
        o IFF ILBM (24 bit, 1-8 bitplanes)
        o PPM/PGM types P5 and P6
        o PNG (grayscale and 24 bit)
        o Targa Truevision (24 bit)
        o Psion PIC format
        o C-code
        o Windows & OS/2 BMP

    - Can do several effects (over 30 effects):
        o AutoCrop & Crop
        o Flip, Shift, Roll
        o Colorspace manipulations
        o Convolute (User-definable masks up to 7x7 size supported! Many
          example masks included. Saving and loading custom masks.)
        o Remove Isolated Pixels
        o Histogram Equalization (local & global)
        o Brightness, contrast & gamma correction
        o Threshold
        o Scale & Resize
        o Image compositing
        o Noise (many variations)
        o Color manipulation (ColorMix, ColorChange, Extract)
        o and many others...

    This release of PPT is called "Descartes" to honor the great
    French mathematician and philosopher.

    Changes from the C-6 release include:

---snip---


Version 5.21 (Thursday, 25-Feb-99 20:22:07)
-------------------------------------------
- ColorChange 1.9: Fixed a buffer overflow, causing Mungwall hits
  occasionally.  Really BGUIs fault.


Version 5.22 (Saturday, 27-Feb-99 22:07:55)
-------------------------------------------
- Added a new iomodule: Psion PIC.


Version 5.23 (Saturday, 13-Mar-99 17:35:24)
-------------------------------------------
- Preview windows now look at font height when deciding where to open.
- Allowed patterns in all file requesters.  Both reported by J-P LeBel.


Version 5.24 (Saturday, 13-Mar-99 18:03:27)
-------------------------------------------
- Bug fix: If a file had a wrong suffix, it would not be recognized
  correctly.  (Reported by J-P LeBel)


Version 5.25 (Sunday, 14-Mar-99 21:04:02)
-----------------------------------------
- Some cosmetical changes
- ASL file requesters now remember their position (a bug in BGUI,
  but could be worked around)
- Speeded up select box handling (still not as fast as I'd like,
  most of the time is consumed in updating the select window
  gadgets
- It's no longer possible to edit a palette if the image has
  not yet been rendered (a workaround to a bug in BGUI).
- Save As now checks if the file already exists and warns you before
  it deletes it. (Suggested by Uwe Pannecke).


Version 5.26 (Wednesday, 17-Mar-99 23:56:35)
--------------------------------------------
- Updated the speed of the select box once more by cutting
  down the selection area refresh rate.  Tell me if this is
  a problem.
- Scale.effect v1.8: Now contains quick doubling and halving
  gadgets.  Also fixed a few minor bugs.  Suggested by several
  people.


Version 5.27 (Sunday, 28-Mar-99 23:53:59)
-----------------------------------------
- PsionPIC 1.1: Saving added.


Version 5.28 (Wednesday, 31-Mar-99 13:30:44)
--------------------------------------------
- Preferences are now saved on exit, unless you use "Quit, lose changes."
- Added start-up tips.
- Render screens now have a title for screen commodities, etc.


Version 5.29 (Sunday, 30-May-99 18:18:52)
-----------------------------------------
- Reworked the entire selection system to accommodate new selection modes.  Currently
  only the former methods are supported, but now it should be easy to create new
  ones.


Version 5.30 (Tuesday, 15-Jun-99 12:51:18)
------------------------------------------
- Point selection now shows a targeting hair whenever you move the mouse.


Version 5.31 (Friday, 18-Jun-99 23:30:46)
-----------------------------------------
- Some cosmetical changes
- Worked extensively on new selection routines, trying to make
  them faster and more reliable.  Still work to do, ho hum...


Version 5.32 (Sunday, 11-Jul-99 23:23:50)
-----------------------------------------
- File open requesters are now multiselect.


Version 5.33 (Sunday, 01-Aug-99 16:51:14)
-----------------------------------------
- Ellipse area selection finally works, but seems to still have some problems
  with certain effects.


Version 6.0 (Saturday, 04-Sep-99 19:58:21)
------------------------------------------
- AskReq() now handles MX objects as well.
- Added BMP.iomod v1.0.
- TIFF.iomod v1.1: Removed LZW support.
