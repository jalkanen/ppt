    PPT is a new, powerful image processing package, that boasts with the
    following properties:

    - Handles both 24 bit truecolor and 8 bit grayscale images with optional
      alpha channel.

    - Modular design, ie. you can easily add new loaders and filters to the
      program.

    - Internal multi-tasking: You can process/load/save many images at
      the same time! No need to wait for another project to be ready!

    - Unlimited (except by available memory) buffers!

    - Unlimited (except by available disk space) undo!

    - User configurable virtual memory (no MMU required)

    - AREXX port

      J. Einman's BGUI package (release 41 needed)

    - Quick preview window for fast updates.

    - Requires OS 2.0 (V37). Yes, this is a feature :) and uses some
      OS 3.0 (V39) features. Takes use of AGA chips if installed.  CyberGFX
      is also supported!
