RELEASE NOTES FOR PPT RELEASE D-1
---------------------------------

After a long wait, here's the D-1 release (V6 of PPT).

This is more or less a feature release, but quite little
features.  Most notably:

- BMP and PsionPIC IOmodules added
- TIFF iomodule is now in the main archive (with LZW support removed)
- Twirl.effect
- New splash screen =)
- Possibility to select circular areas (yay!)
- Open File now supports multiselect
- Tips for newbies
- Preferences (and window positions) are now saved on quit, unless you
  use "Quit, discard changes" - menu item.

On the downside, I fear this release has not been so extensively tested
as the last ones.  I have been extremely busy, and I have also reworked
MAJOR portions of the PPT code, so there might well be a bug or two
still residing here.  In addition, this version is noticeably slower
than the last release.  This is because the next version will support
arbitrary shaped areas, and lots of the support code have not yet
been optimized in any way.

Known bugs:
- Circular selection will be displayed wrong with previews sometimes.
- Some effects do not like circular selection either.
- Undo is problematic with some effects
- Twirl does not work as well as I'd like.
- Circle selection sometimes does not work pixel-perfect. I suspect
  a roundoff error.
