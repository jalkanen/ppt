RELEASE NOTES FOR PPT RELEASE C-6
---------------------------------

This version fixes a number of bugs that got into the last release
(mainly due to the hurry I had to get it out by Christmas).  See
HISTORY for more info.

In addition, I have added the possibility to use images in the toolbar.
You'll need OS V3.x for it, though.  I'll add V37 support, if someone
*really* wants it.

Other cool stuff includes:
- dithered previews (and possibility to use ordered dither in rendering)
- AppIcon
- A number of icons contributed by A. Tolonen.  Yes, you can now
  make your own icons =)

Known bugs:
- the images in toolbar may not function correctly in all places.  This
  is caused by a combination of bugs in CyberGfx, BGUI, and PPT.  I'll
  try to fix them as much as I can for the next release.
