RELEASE NOTES FOR PPT RELEASE C-1
---------------------------------

This is the first public release of PPT.  I know, it
has taken a long time to become a publically available software,
but being a busy student and then a busy person has not
exactly made my time less scarce.

Anyway, here it is:  The fruit of a long and dubious relationship.

I dedicate this release to all those developers who
have stayed with the Amiga all this time.  Without you, we'd
all be Wintel now.
