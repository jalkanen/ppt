RELEASE NOTES FOR PPT RELEASE D-2
---------------------------------

Okay, this is a bigger release in a sense - I am introducing two
new features:

- Free-form area selection (just press your mouse button and go)
- Batch processing.

Neither of these work very well at the moment, I am afraid: the
free-form area selection tends to miss some shapes and the
required support for batch processing is in very few plugins
just yet.  See HISTORY for more information.

If someone can provide me with a better script than what
"BatchProcess.prx" is right now, please do.  I'm not really
that much of an AREXX guru...

Consider this a beta release, so that I can check if the new
features work at all on your computers.  And I wanted you to
have something new to play with ;-)

On a brighter note, a number of bugs were squashed, including
the problems with the circle area selection and the text.effect
crash.
