Hi there!

You've just received the internal debug version of PPT.  Please note that
you may not under any circumstances spread this version.

You will need to make the following assignment before starting PPT:

Assign DTMP: <some place on your hard drive>

I recommend using a non-critical partition, because if PPT crashes during
execution, it may cause invalidation of the partition.  You have been warned.
Another possibility is to start PPT from CLI, and state the location of the
debug directory from the command  line, like:

pptd hd2:debug_directory

When PPT has finished executing, you will find a number of files in the
DTMP: directory.  The files are as follows:

    ppt.log : the main log file
    load_??.log : loader log file
    save_??.log : save log file
    effect_??.log : effect log file
    render_??.log : rendering log file

If you encounter problems, please send me these files, as well as any
Enforcer logs, output from ShowConfig, CGXConfig and anything else
you can think of.  "List sys:wbstartup" might also be a good idea.
