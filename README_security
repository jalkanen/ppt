This archive contains the two files missing from the PPT distribution
archive.  Note that it may be illegal for you to possess cryptographic
software, so if that is the case, you should delete this archive and
its contents immediately.

You see, it's not that I have something against you using my software,
but I think I need to warn you that there is the distinct possibility
that someone might take offense in you using this software.  I don't care,
feel free to use it.  Just be aware of the risks...

I know of at least the following countries, in which cryptography is
banned:
    France
    China
    Singapore

If you know any more, please inform me.

This archive contains both steganographic material as well as an
implementation of the DES algorithm.
