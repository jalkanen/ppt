This archive contains stuff that falls under the UNISYS LZW patent, which
is why you may not wish to use it.  Also, distributing this archive on any
CD-ROM, coverdisk, etc. may be against the law, or at least require paying
license fees to UNISYS, so you might not want to do it.

So, if you use them, use them on your own responsibility.  It might even
be illegal in your country.
